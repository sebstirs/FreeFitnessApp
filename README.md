# FreeFitnessApp

Fitness apps are over abundant in the app store this makes it hard to find fitness apps that meet your needs.  Almost all fitness apps require a monthly or annual subscription.  Others are not customizable to every user's needs, or contian pesky ads. The problem we are trying to solve is to create a free app with fully customizable workouts,  progress tracking, and beginner tutorials.
