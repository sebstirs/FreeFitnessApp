# FreeFitnessApp

Fitness apps are over abundant in the app store this makes it hard to find fitness apps that meet your needs.  Almost all fitness apps require a monthly or annual subscription.  Others are not customizable to every user's needs, or contian pesky ads. The problem we are trying to solve is to create a free app with fully customizable workouts,  progress tracking, and beginner tutorials.


Setup:

Install Flutter via https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install 

Install sqflite package via https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite

Install the path provider package via https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider

Once flutter is installed create a new project titled FreeFitnessApp. Copy the main.dart file to the /lib folder. Copy the dependencys and assets in the pubspec.yaml file under the FreeFitnessApp folder. Download the /assests folder in the /FreeFtinessApp folder (This will enable the pictures in the app, otherwise it will show an error message of file not found)
